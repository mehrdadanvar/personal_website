    <p class="my-3">
      <span class="text-4xl">I</span>
      was born at the end of the 8-year conflict between Iran and Iraq in a small town to the southwest of Iran. My mother who was the head of school
      of nursing at the time was on the final year of graduating from Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Growing up in an academic family, I
      developed a natural inclination towards comprehending the intricacies of the human body and health. My passion for these subjects led me to
      pursue high school biology and eventually, medical school.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      After eight years of intensive medical training at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and involvement in various research projects, my
      outlook on healthcare broadened. While treating patients was a key part of my daily routine, I found myself drawn to making a larger impact on
      public health. However, the curriculum was heavily geared toward preparing clinicians to manage crowded clinics, with limited emphasis on
      research. To bridge this gap, I devised a long-term self-education plan built on two key pillars that have shaped my professional journey.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      The first pillar was developing a solid foundation in research methodology. I attended university workshops that taught me statistics and
      quantitative reasoning, sparking my interest in computer science and programming—areas that have since become passions of mine. The second
      pillar involved deepening my theoretical knowledge through hands-on experience. I volunteered to help draft and edit research projects and
      dissertations, collaborated with peers and seniors, and later offered guidance in turning raw ideas into well-structured research proposals.
      These experiences also honed my skills in dataset analysis tailored to each project’s needs.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      By the end of my medical education, I had gained experience across a variety of study designs, from narrative reviews to clinical trials. Today,
      I combine my clinical expertise with a population-level understanding of healthcare, proudly embracing the role of a curious and data-driven
      medical professional.
