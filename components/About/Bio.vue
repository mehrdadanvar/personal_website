      I was born in a small town in southwestern Iran, just as the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq was coming to an
      end. At the time, my mother was finishing her final year at Tehran University of Medical Sciences while also
      serving as head of the local school of nursing. Growing up in an academically driven household, I naturally
      gravitated toward the sciences, especially the complex workings of the human body. That early curiosity led me to
      focus on biology in high school and ultimately pursue a career in medicine.

    <p class="my-3">
      During my eight years of rigorous training at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, I was involved in both
      clinical work and research. While I valued the day-to-day connection with patients, I gradually became more
      interested in broader questions about public health and healthcare systems. The medical curriculum, however, was
      primarily designed to train hands-on clinicians, leaving limited space for in-depth research training. To address
      this, I created a personal roadmap centered around two long-term goals that have since guided my professional
      development.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      The first was to build a strong foundation in research methods. I began attending workshops in statistics and
      quantitative analysis, which unexpectedly sparked a lasting interest in computer science and programming. The
      second goal was to gain practical research experience. I volunteered to assist with research proposals and thesis
      projects, working alongside colleagues at different stages of their careers. Over time, I began mentoring others
      as well, helping shape ideas into structured, methodologically sound studies. These collaborations also gave me
      valuable experience in data analysis tailored to diverse research questions.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      By the time I completed medical school, I had worked on a wide range of study typesâ€”from narrative reviews to
      clinical trials. Today, I draw on both my clinical background and research skills to approach healthcare from an
      integrated, population-level perspective. I see myself not only as a physician but as a data-informed
      problem-solver, always eager to explore new questions and improve how care is delivered.
