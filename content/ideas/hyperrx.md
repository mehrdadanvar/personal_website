## Why and What Problem It Solves

Currently there are no freely accessible databases of drug product information for medical students tailored to their clinical needs. Moreover the existing technologies do offer and a programming interface for fast and efficient retrieval.My focus in designing the "Hyper" series of projects have been to consolidate all information needs of students in one platform. HyperRx will be part of the upcoming HyperQbank project.

## How It Works

Health Canada periodically publishes extracts of the **Drug Product Database** (DPD) on their
::ProseA{href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/drug-product-database/what-data-extract-drug-product-database.html" target="\_blank"}
website.
::
The extracts are SQL-like text dumps of the DPD database including multiple tables which house information on drug products including identifiers, forms, strengths, and routes of administration and manufacturer information. For a full list of details please visit this
